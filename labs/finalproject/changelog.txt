5/27
Started implementing the up/downvote system. 
Major bugs came about in regard to the writing of the post objects.
After 3 hours, I resolved it. It was due to me confusing types of the
variables (I wish there was explicit typing!).
Buttons have been reworked into links so more than one variable can be 
passed into the url (Gordon's idea).
