Used Gordon's post writing code. Rewrote it to have smarter formatting
Improved post display by including usernames

5/24
Added a post ID system as well as beginning to implement commenting

5/25
Beginning to read in files

5/26
Rewrote entire project to use objects. Much cleaner and comment system working.
Log out buttons implemented

5/27
Started implementing the up/downvote system. 
Major bugs came about in regard to the writing of the post objects.
After 3 hours, I resolved it. It was due to me confusing types of the
variables (I wish there was explicit typing!).
Buttons have been reworked into links so more than one variable can be 
passed into the url (Gordon's idea).

Another project rewrite. This happens to be the drawbacks of not
planning from the beginning. I rewrote the stdStuff classes to
use inheritance (potentially useful in the future). The code has been 
refactored so most of the classes now have instance methods (such as
display). The rest of the pages have been rewritten to make use of the new
functions. The main reason for the second rewrite is to make the
implementation of friends simpler. The User class now has an array to store 
posts.

Another minor code rewrite by me, this time making the objFileToList
function (in stdStuff) to allow for creation of dictionaries with 
usernames as keys. I mainly did this to lessen code size due to needing to
constantly search all users for the current user.
I finally started work on inboxes. Another page has been made for it. So far,
users can send messages to other users with a title and message. Maybe we'll
support replying later. The sending function handles users that don't exist.
In addition, I implemented the ability to mark posts as read or as unread,
allowing the user to see one or the other as they wish.
I also made for all TextContainers to be sorted by id, so newer things show
up first.

In class, I merged code with Gordon, using his post search engine. I started
work on the friend system. I managed to make a function that, given a search
string, can look through the dictionary of users to see if they are there.

I worked a bit on the friend requesting system. I made a new FriendRequest
class that inherits from message. I did this so I could implement methods
such as acceptRequest and declineRequest. This distinction also allows for
the inbox to display the two differently. As of now, the request gets
directly sent to the same area of the inbox. I would like to change it so
there is a seperate area in the inbox for requests.

6/02
I merged code with Gordon, taking the code he wrote to limit the amount of
up/downvotes a user can perform to one (only for posts so far). In turn, I 
gave him the code I started for the friend requests. Speaking of which, 
I continued work on the system, deciding ultimately to include the 
requests in the same area of the inbox, but above all other messages. Taking
advantage of inheritance, I was able to add different links below friend 
requests (accept and decline) while being able to maintain the same overall
message structure that is seen in Message objects. Finally, I fixed up post
viewing so that now one can see posts from all there friends as well.

6/03
We have practically implemented all the features we originally wanted, so we
were discussing what else to add. I wroked on the ability to reply to messages
while Gordon worked on making groups. I did not get very far on the message
reply system.
