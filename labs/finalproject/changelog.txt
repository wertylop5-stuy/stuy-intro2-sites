Rewrote entire project to use objects. Much cleaner and comment system working.
Log out buttons implemented

5/27
Started implementing the up/downvote system. 
Major bugs came about in regard to the writing of the post objects.
After 3 hours, I resolved it. It was due to me confusing types of the
variables (I wish there was explicit typing!).
Buttons have been reworked into links so more than one variable can be 
passed into the url (Gordon's idea).

Another project rewrite. This happens to be the drawbacks of not
planning from the beginning. I rewrote the stdStuff classes to
use inheritance (potentially useful in the future). The code has been 
refactored so most of the classes now have instance methods (such as
display). The rest of the pages have been rewritten to make use of the new
functions. The main reason for the second rewrite is to make the
implementation of friends simpler. The User class now has an array to store 
posts.

Another minor code rewrite by me, this time making the objFileToList
function (in stdStuff) to allow for creation of dictionaries with 
usernames as keys. I mainly did this to lessen code size due to needing to
constantly search all users for the current user.
I finally started work on inboxes. Another page has been made for it. So far,
users can send messages to other users with a title and message. Maybe we'll
support replying later. The sending function handles users that don't exist.
In addition, I implemented the ability to mark posts as read or as unread,
allowing the user to see one or the other as they wish.
I also made for all TextContainers to be sorted by id, so newer things show
up first.

In class, I merged code with Gordon, using his post search engine. I started
work on the friend system. I managed to make a function that, given a search
string, can look through the dictionary of users to see if they are there.
