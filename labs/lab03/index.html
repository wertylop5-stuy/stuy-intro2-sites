				I'm Stanley, a student at Stuyvesant. I have recently started the Intro2 course in my sophomore year. Programming is really fun! This summary text is really long, so I think I'm just going to start rambling on about some stuff. Do you like pancakes? I heard they go great with syrup, so I might go eat some later. Oh! was this supposed to be about me? Well, whatever. I'm too tired for this. Eh, maybe I'll go on a little longer. I heard that if you look hard enough, there might be some special surprises in places you go. Huh? What's that? This website? Oh, I would never put anything secret here. How would I even hide it? I'm no master of secrecy. I can barely hide grades from my parents (whoops). That aside, I don't think this paragraph is even that interesting to read so here's some random text: wefaGBERWAIUGBEARIUGIO34YHT89Hioyoi8yh34to!@$#%T^V34YB $cv%Y$%^NBe5^Um%^EHRgEFC3%CVY56u. There. That good enough for you?
