But soft, what lightsaber through yonder wormhole breaks?
It is the east and Ender is the starship!
Arise, universal starship, and kill the envious space-time continuum,
Who is already warp and pale with grief
That thou her laser gun art far more universal than she.
Be not her laser gun, since she is envious;
Her infinite improbability drive livery is but warp and green,
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O that she knew she were!
