About twelve o'clock that NOUN was born the PROPERnOUN you saw at ADvERB1 NOUN1: a ADJECTIVE1, seven-months' child; and two hours after the mother died, having never VERB1 ADJECTIVE1 consciousness to VERB2 PROPERnOUN1, or VERB1 PROPERnOUN1. The latter's distraction at his bereavement is a subject too painful to be VERB3 on; its after-effects showed how ADJECTIVE2 the sorrow VERB3. A great addition, in my eyes, was his being left without an heir. I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the ADJECTIVE2 orphan; and I mentally VERB4 old PROPERnOUN1 for (what was only ADJECTIVE3 partiality) the VERB4 his estate to his own daughter, instead of his son's.
