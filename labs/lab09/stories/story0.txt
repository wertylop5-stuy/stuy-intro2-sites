But soft, what NOUN1 through yonder NOUN breaks?
It is the east and PROPERnOUN is the NOUN2!
Arise, ADJECTIVE1 NOUN2, and kill the envious NOUN,
Who is already VERB1 and pale with grief
That thou her NOUN3 art far more ADJECTIVE1 than she.
Be not her NOUN3, since she is envious;
Her NOUN4 livery is but VERB1 and green,
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O that she knew she were!
